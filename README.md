# What is this?
This is my project for the data analysis course with Professor [Haley Massa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/haley-massa-b25b01109/).
There are *two parts* to this project. First is the **EDA** where I analysed russia equipment losses and tweets related to the ukraine war, around the time it started.
Second is **modelling** which builds off of the **EDA** where I used word2vec and two scikit-learn models. Within each part, there is a pdf file detailing what was done and achieved. **midterm project.pdf** and **final project mat.pdf**. Jupyter notebooks are provided as well, showcasing my steps.
# Guidelines and rubric
 You will also find the rubric and guideline that was used to grade each part(**Midterm Project-Mat455.pdf** and **Final Project.pdf**).
